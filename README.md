##Loan VS Credit Risk 
Machine learning based on input data (Lending_data) and we split into 2 group
#Type 1 we used as study purpose and type 2 "Target" we test input and use formula form Type 1 see if output close to our known answer
# Machine Leanring try to minimus the variance and predict more accurate answer for any future event 
# In my homework I used Logistic Regression which is type of classification and accuracy reaches 99%
# Inside Test Matrix we can see KPI for each section (True positive""TP", True negative"TN", False Negtive"FN", and False Positive"FP")
#According to Metrics result we can see accuracy 99%, for "0" precision and recall both 100% and for "1" recall is 90%, after we resample them ,accuracy still 99% but "1" recall increased form 90% to 99% 
## In conclusion resampled model brings better result with 99% accuracy ,whihc is better.
