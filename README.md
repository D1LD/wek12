### Week12

# # # Loan VS Credit Risk Machine Leanring 

# In my homework I used Logistic Regression which is type of classification method and in my test both method accuracy reaches 99%
# Machine learning based on input data (Lending_data) and we split into 2 group
# Type 1 we used for study purpose and type 2 "Target" are for test purpose , input test data and check if output close to our known answer
# # I try to minimus the variance and predict more accurate answer for any future event 
# Inside Test Matrix we can see KPI for each section (True positive""TP", True negative"TN", False Negtive"FN", and False Positive"FP")
# According to Metrics result we can see accuracy 99%, for "0" precision and recall both 100% and for "1" recall is 90%, after we resample them ,accuracy still 99% but "1" recall increased form 90% to 99% 
## In conclusion resampled model brings better result with 99% accuracy ,whihc is better.
